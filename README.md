The Problem (In nyc)
One of NYC’s biggest challenges is affordable housing. 🤑 Understanding rent burden, eviction trends, and neighborhood costs is one of the most important things to know for aspiring New Yorkers. 

The Solution (DA SITE) ‼️‼️‼️
An interactive NYC Housing Insights Portal that visualizes real data like housing costs, competition, and eviction statistics in a clear, public-friendly way. 

The Engaging Element (DA GAME) ‼️‼️‼️
To keep users engaged, we will pair the portal with a simple two-player construction-site fighting game called HATE TO HOUSE . Players fight on scaffolding while the loser ‘falls off the housing ladder,’ representing how competitive and how ppl have to  the housing system can feel.

Why it helps?
This combo makes a complex issue understandable and memorable: the site informs, and the game reinforces the theme through being fun.

What are we gonna use?
We will use HTML/CSS/JS for the portal, Godot for the game, and we will integrate the game  into the site.
We are making a game, a map, a tab for data and information. Supposed to be informative. : D

Conclusion
An accessible, visually engaging way to learn about a real NYC challenge in a format people will actually interact with.
