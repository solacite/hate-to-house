Theme:
NYC's housing crisis

The Problem (In nyc)
One of NYC’s biggest challenges is affordable housing. It's helpful to know population and vacancy of specific areas in nyc in order to make informed choices on housing.

The Solution (DA SITE)
An interactive website that visualizes real data like housing issues such as competition, population, and vacancy statistics in a clear way as well as a map to visualize this data.

The Engaging Element (DA GAME)
A simple two-player construction-site fighting game called HATE TO HOUSE. Players fight for property on the rooftops of buildings in nyc and the winner gets the house!

What did we use?
We've used HTML,CSS,JS for the portal, Godot for the game, and integrated the game into the site.
We have a game, a map, a tab for data and information. Supposed to be informative. : D

Conclusion
An accessible, visually engaging way to learn about a real NYC challenge in a format people will actually interact with
