            <div id="header">The Problem (In NYC and probably other places)<br>One of NYC’s biggest challenges is affordable housing (as we all know). Some of the most
        important things for aspiring New Yorkers to understand are rent burden, eviction trends
        (because tax evasion), and neighborhood costs.</div>
            <div id="content">The Solution (THA SITE)<br>We've made an interactive NYC Housing visualizer of (forged (jk)) real data on housing costs,
        competition, and eviction statistics.</div>
            <div id="sidebar">The Fun Part (ACTUAL GAME)<br> We've paired our statistics with a game centered on being not homeless! In NYC!
        It's a two-player game called HATE TO HOUSE, where you fight to shove your opponent off the
        house to not be homeless (the other person is thus left homeless and dead). Have fun :D</div>
