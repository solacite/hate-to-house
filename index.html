    <h2>The Problem (In NYC)</h2>
    <p>
        One of NYC’s biggest challenges is affordable housing. Understanding rent burden,
        eviction trends, and neighborhood costs is one of the most important things to know
        for aspiring New Yorkers.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution (DA SITE)</h2>
    <p>
        An interactive NYC Housing Insights Portal that visualizes real data like housing costs,
        competition, and eviction statistics in a clear, public-friendly way.

    <h2>The Engaging Element (DA GAME)</h2>
    <p>
        To keep users engaged, we will pair the portal with a simple two-player construction-site
        fighting game called HATE TO HOUSE. Players fight on scaffolding while the loser
        “falls off the housing ladder,” representing how competitive the housing system can feel.
